an mcp client that takes resume pdf, links , etc and makes a me-mcp-server repo for a person.
like a static site generator.
me-maker jake.yaml --anthropic-api-key $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
me-maker jake.yaml --deploy
me-maker jake.yaml --serve # outputs the config for claude desktop to connect
me-maker jake.yaml --language python --anthropic-api-key $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
me-maker jake.yaml --llm-endpoint http://ollama:3.2/ 

the config file, the arguments and the language template should always result in the same mcp client except maybe the llm will interpret content differently

the llm converts the resume to text, reads website contents to text, pulls down info from linkedin, etc.
everything else is basically just a static site generator. so we could use an existing generator and just
generate the config for it.

lets add a test client that makes sure the generated mcp server is correct and shows the user what it will be giving the llm.
